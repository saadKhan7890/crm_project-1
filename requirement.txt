Bulk Uploading Common Issues doesn't require item Type / Item class, we just have to upload issues with proper grouping like client provided

for product sheet - Brand should be ID, and Item Type should be ID as well 

Make sure to allow export on brands listing, item type listing and every other listing as well (export should be in excel not csv)
